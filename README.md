To be completed in the last module of the semester.

## Information System Components

## Software
### GitHub 
  I have no experience using GitHub, for my first time using it it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I do use cloud computing a lot throughout my day. I use google drive for other classes and I have a subscription for PLaystaionNow which is cloud based gaming service I use on my PC. Also play on servers on my PC and some of the older games are client-side server based so I wuld end up being the client host for games. I look forward to how GitHub uses these in its own way.
