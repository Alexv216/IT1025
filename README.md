## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

## Information System Components
  Many people use ATM's out of convenience. An ATM machine is an information system that conducts transactions automatically without the need to go to the bank. The hardware used to complete the process usually consists of a bank card that has the users data being scanned by the ATM. The hardware used to scan is normally a chip on the card and then the user can select what functions they would like to perfomr using the touch screen or keyboard on the ATM. The banks software installed and linked into the ATM then sends that data to the servers that holds customer account information and completes the transaction. 
## Software
The roles of application, utility, and operating system software are vital to a functioning computer. The role of application software is to accomplish a specific goal such as word processing, calculations on a spreadsheet, or using the internet on a browser. The role of utility is to fix or modify a computer. Examples include anti-malware software and programs that totally remove software no longer wanted installed. Operating systems are the brain of computers, the role of the operating system is to manage the hardware resources of the computer, providing the user-interface components, and to provide a platform for software developers to write applications. An example of operating systems are Windows, Mac OS and Linux.
### GitHub 
  I have no experience using GitHub, for my first time using it it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I do use cloud computing a lot throughout my day. I use google drive for other classes and I have a subscription for PLaystaionNow which is cloud based gaming service I use on my PC. Also play on servers on my PC and some of the older games are client-side server based so I wuld end up being the client host for games. I look forward to how GitHub uses these in its own way.
### Screen Capture
  I used Windows' snipping tool to get the ScreenCapture.PNG image that I uploaded which was 424 KB (435,155 bytes). 
### Operating Systems and File Management
### ERP
ERP was developed to bring together an entire organization within one program. it utilizes a central database, all users of the ERP edit and save their information from the same data source, includes functionality that covers all of the essential components of a business. Examples of ERP systems are SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft.
### Python
Python is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum. It has efficient high-level data structures and effective approaches to object-oriented programming. The difference between an interpreted language and a compiled language is a compiled language is converted from the source language  into a language that is spoken by the computer using a compiler. An interpreted language runs the program directly from the source code, it converts the source code into bytecodes and then translates it into the native language of your computer and then runs it. 
The file "Python1" contains the "Hello Alex!" code and is 27.9 KB, the file "Python2" contains the lines of code that produces "The number is 17" and "My name is Alex" with the use of variables, it is 17.7 KB.
### Python IDLE 
The difference between IDLE and file editor is that IDLE runs Python instructions one at a time and shows results immediately while file editor lets the user enter Python code for complete programs. Also IDLE has the triple angle bracket.
### Virtualization
The purpose of virtualization is to create useful IT services using resources that are traditionally bound to hardware. It allows a physical machine’s full capacity to be used by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments. An example of this are virtual machines and how they can virtualize operating systems if the user does not want to install the OS itself on a physical hard drive. The role of hypervisors in virtualization is to take physical resources and divide them up so that virtual environments can use them. 
### Graphics Modeling and Rendering

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
The difference between raster and vector graphics are that with raster graphics when you zoom in on a picture you can see the pixels that make up the image while with vector graphics the image does not lose its quality when you zoom in on it. 
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Each image format is important for different reasons. When using lossless image compression all of the data from the original file is preserved while lossy compression removes some data from the original file and saves the image with a reduced file size. Depending on how important the image is to the website and if it is one that needs to be high quality or not, web developers can either save space or produce high quality images for users.
### File Formats
The diferences between JPEG, GIF, and PNG files are their functions. JPEG files use lossy compression to create smaller file sizes and allows designers to finely adjust the amount of compression used, resulting in better image quality with the smallest reasonable file size. GIF files are the only type of format that allows animated images to be produced. PNG files use lossless data compression and support palette-based color, greyscale, RGBA and RGB color spaces, it also supports a number of transparency options, including alpha channel transparency.
### Artificial Intelligence

## Computer Architecture
### CPU
The purpose of the CPU is to function as the brain of the computer. It processes data from the RAM, it also displays output data and takes in input data to perform tasks for programs. The control unit takes instructions from RAM and sends out commands to the other parts of the CPU. The ALU performs all of the math operations of the CPU. The control unit takes the information from RAM and sends operations for the ALU to solve and send an answer to the control unit to decide what to do when it receives new instructions.
When using a self checkout station, the CPU of the station gets instructions from the input of the barcode scanned. It then processes the input as the item scanned and then processes the data as the output on the monitor displaying the price and what the item is. 
### Gates and Circuits
A truth table shows the output for every possible input. It is meant to take in two inputs and compare them to determine the correct ouput. The AND table focuses on output only with all inputs. For example, If both inputs are 1, the output will be 1 as well. Otherwise the output will be 0. The OR table depends on if either input is 1, the output will be 1 as well. Otherwise the output will be 0.
### Memory
Increasing RAM increases the computing speed because if there isn't enough memory to processes data then the data is going back to the hard drive that is slower causing  the PC to work slower than a PC with a significantly larger amount of memory that can store and transfer the data at higher rates.The difference between 64-bit and 32-bit data path is that 64-bit can process 64 bits of data per cycle compared to the 32-bit datapath. Making the 64-bit twice as fast than the 32-bit
### RAM vs. Hard Disk Storage
Two difference between RAM and hard disk storage is that RAM is much faster at processing data to the CPU while hard disk storage is slower and hard disk storage can hold the data for a longer time while RAM can only store data for a short time.
### Storage
### Latency and Transfer Rates 
The differnece between latrency and transfer rates is that latency is a drive’s average access time between the time a request for data is made by the system and the time the data is available from the drive which is measured in miliseconds and transfer rates is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media and is a function of the recording frequency measured in megabytes per second.
### Solid State vs. Traditional Hard Drives
  The difference between a solid state drive and the traditional hard drive is that a solid state drive does not use disks, heads, platters, magnetic surfaces, spindles and other complex moving parts that the traditional hard drive uses.  The solid state is also faster and more effective than a hard drive since it does not rely on the movement of a disk that can wear out with time.
### Data Representation
The difference between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representation is the base powers they are based on. The decimal system is based on the base power of 10 and has 10 digits, the binary system is based on the base power of 2 and only has 2 digits. The binary system is also an 8-bit data representation and can only go up to 255. The hexadecimal system is a 16-digit data representation and is based off the base power of 16. Hexadecimal also uses letters to fill in for the digits passed the number 9. For example, 10 is A and 15 is represented by F.
The file 3DecimalConversion.png shows the conversion of the decimal 156 into binary. The file size is 6.77 KBs. The file 4BinvaryConversion.png is 6.63 KBs in size and it shows the binary code of 11111101 converted into the decimal 253.
### Hexadecimal Color Representation 
The hexadecimal color #ab00ff has RGB values of R:171, G:0, B:255 and CMYK values of C:0.33, M:1, Y:0, K:0. Its decimal value is 11206911. The color could be problematic as the color does not register well with those who are colorblind because the red would not be able to be seen so it only looks like a shade of blue or a very dulled down pinkish color.
### IEEE
IEEE is an organization that focuses on advancing the innovation and technology for the benefit of humanity. Their approach on the ethics of computing consists of ways of how to make technology grener for the environment and how to make sure that technology benefits all of humanity without hurting others. 
## Networking
### Data Transmission
The data transmission process starts with the protocol, each device must follow a set a rules to allow each other to communicate. Once the protocol is set one device will send units of data called packets to another device to perform a task. This is done by packet-switching, technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address. When trying to access a website the device trying to access the site will send packets to request to access the DNS which is the directory of IP address common names and an IP address is the unique identifying number of a device.
### Hardware
The benefit of a switch over a hub is the secuirty of the switch and its intelligence and can memorize MAC addresses, reducing unneccesary traffic. The beneift of a router over both hubs and switches is a router can send data outside its own network and routes data from one network to another based opn IP addresses.
### Topologies and Types of Networks
Single point of failure is when a switch or hub shuts down or fails, causing all the computers to fail, causing an entire network to go down. 
The difference between infrastructure topology and wireless mesh topology is that infrastructure topology has both wired and wireless devices, such as laptops can connect to the network while wireless mesh topology is like mesh topology but requires no extra cable connection as all of teh wireless access points would talk to each toher sending data to the modem. 
I think that having a wireless mesh topology is better because it is more convenient and can reroute data if any issues come up. It also requires less cables running throughout the building making it easier to get work done anywhere as long as there is a connection. 
### Protocols
Network protocols take large-scale processes and break them down into small tasks. Each function must cooperate at each level to complete the larger task. The three types of protocols are communication, security, and network mangement. Communication protocols allow different devices to communicate with each other.An example of this is transferring files between devices and accessing the internet. Security protocols ensure that the network and the data sent over it are protected from unauthorized users. An example of security protocol is encrypting data to ensure only authorized users can only see the data. Network management protocols define and describe the various procedures needed to effectively operate a computer network to ensure the network perform optimally such as establishing and maintaining stable connections between different devices on the same network.
### IP Address
IP addresses are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces. Computers then translate these numerical addresses so they can send data to the right location. The two types of IP addresses are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are written as a string of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots. IPv6 addresses are considerably longer strings of numbers, so they are written using hexadecimals to fit more information into fewer digits. Colons separate the segments of IPv6 addresses instead of dots. Also, when  two colons are side by side in an IPv6 address, you know that all the segments between them contain only zeros.
### ICANN
As the operator of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions, ICANN allocates IP address blocks to the five Regional Internet Registries
around the world. The RIRs then allocate smaller IP address blocks to ISPs and other network operators. From there, the ISPs and other Internet operators assign the addresses to the individual Internet connections.
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP stands for "Hypertext Transfer Protocol", it is one of the most widely used protocols on the internet since it is used for viewing web pages. HTTP is an example of client-server because it requests access to view a website from a web server so the client can view the site.
### Protocols for Secure HTTP
The protocols used by secure HTTP are SSL and Tls. SSL stands for Secure Socket Layering and is the basic form of HTTP security. When conncecting to a site that uses SSL security the web browser asks the web server for its SSL certificate to verify that it is secure. Once verified, all dafa transferred between the browser and server wil be encrypted and exchanged. TLS is the successor of SSL and it stands for Transport Layer Security. It is the latest industry standard and asks for the same requirements as SSL and secures data just like SSL as well. 

## Cybersecurity and Encryption
### Security Triad
The three components of the security triad is confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Each one of these components would affect online medical records like MyChart in different ways. For example, the confidentiality component keeps the data of each patient confidential to them only and thier doctor. Integrity ensures that the information displayed on record has not been altered or incorrect in any way. Finally, availability of information of the patient. New diagnoses and test results need to be available for patients to view any new information on thier health.
### Caesar and Polyalphabetic Ciphers
A polyalphabetic cipher is a cipher that contains a shift word within the first layer of code. While a Caesar cipher are words with the letters shifted a certain number of letters, the polyalphabetic cipher takes the code and uses a word to shift the the enitre message even more making a lighter letter frequency, making it mmore diffivult tofind the shift word. 
### Public and Private Key Encryption
Public key encryption is an ecryption method where encrypting data with two different keys and making one of the public key available for anyone to use. Private key encryption is a form of encryption where only a single private key can encrypt and decrypt information
### Brute-Force Attacks
There are several methods to improve protection against brute force attacks. Using a long, unique password makes it more difficult to discover your password. Aslo,having a securing remote desktop connections leaving a remote desktop off as much as possible helps too. Using two-factor authentication is far more difficult to crack through when a correct password isn’t enough to log into an account. With 2FA, users need their phone or a physical security key to log into their accounts, making the account far more secure.
## Internet Programming
### Components of a URL
Scheme:https 

Domain: www.amazon.com 

Top Level Domain: .edu 

Default Page: no file path provided 

Parameters: result of search 

Anchor: specific location on a page. 

Each component is important to the URL’s structure. For example, the scheme can tell a user whether or not a site is secure with the “https” scheme.  The domain name gives users access to the site with an easy to remember name such as google.com. Also, when searching through google, the parameter string is vital to the servers understanding of what a user may be trying to search The top level domain shows users what kind of site they're about to enter whether it is .edu for an education based site or .org for an organization. The anchor can take users to a specific part of a website to save time on scrolling through the default page and traversing the file path.  

### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web and he created W3C to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web.
The standard I find to be important is the Web of Devices standard. Giving web access to any device such as phones and other mobile devices as well as consumer electronics, printers, interactive television, and even automobiles is very important as the availability increases the accessability for those who may not have been able to use web technology previously. It also can improve the quality of life for users of some of the devices.
## File Compression
File compression is a way of grouping multiple files so they act like one file, making the total file size smaller and it takes less time to upload and downloads more quickly.

The difference between the original svg file and the compressed zip file was not as big as i thought it would be. The file was originally 24KB and when compressed it went down to 17KB. I would expect a JPEG file reduce signifcantly when reduced to a zip since I have had to compress a JPEG file once in order to send it to a friend and the reduction in file size was massive. 
## Software Development
### Algorithms
### Object Oriented Concepts
The attributes of the shark class are objects sammy and stevie and the methods in the shark class are "swim" and "be awesome". The puropse of  the constructor is to initialize data and run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. A class is like a foundation that can be defined to use and create objects. Objects are instances of a class and where the class is manifested in the program. To instantiate an object from a class is to make the object a subcategory of the class, for examples some species may have sub-species. The main species is the class, the sub-species is the object that is instantiated from the class. The command I used to instantiate objects sammy, stevie, and alex of the shark class was "def __init__(self, name):". OOP inheritance is one class being created out of another class. An example in the shark class inheritance would be two classes seperating which object is swimming and which object is being awesome. 
### UML
The diagram I created called SharkClass shows the names of the sharks and the attributes of the class. Each shark can either perform the function of swimming or being awesome with the method in the class.
## Database Systems
### SQL, NoSQL, and Big Data Technologies
SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it is used as a way to analyze and manipulate relational data ranging from a simple request for data to a complex update operation. NoSQL is another type of database. Compared to SQL, NoSQL can work with data in a looser way, allowing for a more unstructured environment, communicating changes to the data over time to all the large-scale databases spread over several servers. The demand for big data has increased due to technologies such as artifical intelligence, NoSQL databases, and organizations.
### The Four V's of Big Data
The four V's of big data are volume, variety, velocity, and variability. Volume is dependent upon the size of data which plays a very crucial role in determining whether the value of a particular data can be considered as Big Data or not. Variety refers both structured and unstructured data and how many types of applications can be used for data analysis. Velocity deals with the speed at which data flows in from sources like business processes, application logs, networks, and social media sites at a massive and continuous flow. Variability is the inconsistency which can be shown by data at times, hampering the process of effective handling and management of the data.


### Data and Business Decisions
Three business decisions that could be answered with a well designed database would be:
1. Determining which department may need more people depending on the output data of the departments performance based on the staff.
2. Seeing if the company is doing well financially and checking to see if it needs to increase or decrease its budget.
3. Determining what the company can do to attract new customers. 
These decisions are dependent on data and a good database can organize data neatly and make finding the solution to these problems much easier. 
### The Relational Model and Normalization
Primary and foreign keys would be essential for the decisions I would have made because I would be able trace which employee belongs to which department and i can determine if that person's needs help or not by looking at the foreign key which relates to their primary key. The normalization of the database would make processing the data much easier to understand and help with analyzing  what improvements need to be made to improve company performance. 
### SQL Injections
SQL injections are a security threat because the code injection might destroy your database. It is one of the most common hacking techniques used by hackers since they can placet malicious code in SQL statements via web page input. SQL parameters are used in order to protect a web site from SQL injection. The parameters set values that are added to a query at execution time in a controlled manner. Also, the SQL engine checks each parameter to ensure that each value is correct for its column and are treated literally not as a part of the SQL that would need to be executed.
