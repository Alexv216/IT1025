## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

## Information System Components
  Many people use ATM's out of convenience. An ATM machine is an information system that conducts transactions automatically without the need to go to the bank. The hardware used to complete the process usually consists of a bank card that has the users data being scanned by the ATM. The hardware used to scan is normally a chip on the card and then the user can select what functions they would like to perfomr using the touch screen or keyboard on the ATM. The banks software installed and linked into the ATM then sends that data to the servers that holds customer account information and completes the transaction. 
## Software
### GitHub 
  I have no experience using GitHub, for my first time using it it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I do use cloud computing a lot throughout my day. I use google drive for other classes and I have a subscription for PLaystaionNow which is cloud based gaming service I use on my PC. Also play on servers on my PC and some of the older games are client-side server based so I wuld end up being the client host for games. I look forward to how GitHub uses these in its own way.
### Screen Capture
  I used Windows' snipping tool to get the ScreenCapture.PNG image that I uploaded which was 424 KB (435,155 bytes).

### Latency and Transfer Rates 
The differnece between latrency and transfer rates are:
  Latency is a driveâ€™s average access time between the time a request for data is made by the system and the time the data is available from the drive which is measured in miliseconds.
  Transfer rates is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media and is a function of the recording frequency measured in megabytes per second.
### Solid State vs. Traditional Hard Drives
  The difference between a solid state drive and the traditional hard drive is that a solid state drive does not use disks, heads, platters, magnetic surfaces, spindles and other complex moving parts that the traditional hard drive uses.  The solid state is also faster and more effective than a harddrive since it does not rely on the movement of a disk that can wear out with time.
