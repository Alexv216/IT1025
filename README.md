## Executive Summary
To be completed in the last module of the semester.

## Information System Components
  Many people use ATM's out of convenience. An ATM machine is an information system that conducts transactions automatically without the need to go to the bank. The hardware used to complete the process usually consists of a bank card that has the users data being scanned by the ATM. The hardware used to scan is normally a chip on the card and then the user can select what functions they would like to perfomr using the touch screen or keyboard on the ATM. The banks software installed and linked into the ATM then sends that data to the servers that holds customer account information and completes the transaction. 
## Software
### GitHub 
  I have no experience using GitHub, for my first time using it it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I do use cloud computing a lot throughout my day. I use google drive for other classes and I have a subscription for PLaystaionNow which is cloud based gaming service I use on my PC. Also play on servers on my PC and some of the older games are client-side server based so I wuld end up being the client host for games. I look forward to how GitHub uses these in its own way.
### Screen Capture
  I used Windows' snipping tool to get the ScreenCapture.PNG image that I uploaded which was 424 KB (435,155 bytes).

## Computer Architecture
### CPU
The purpose of the CPU is to function as the brain of the computer. It processes data from the RAM, it also displays output data and takes in input data to perform tasks for programs. The control unit takes instructions from RAM and sends out commands to the other parts of the CPU. The ALU performs all of the math operations of the CPU. The control unit takes the information from RAM and sends operations for the ALU to solve and send an answer to the control unit to decide what to do when it receives new instructions.
When using a self checkout station, the CPU of the station gets instructions from the input of the barcode scanned. It then processes the input as the item scanned and then processes the data as the output on the monitor displaying the price and what the item is. 
### Gates and Circuits
A truth table shows the output for every possible input. It is meant to take in two inputs and compare them to determine the correct ouput. The AND table focuses on output only with all inputs. For example, If both inputs are 1, the output will be 1 as well. Otherwise the output will be 0. The OR table depends on if either input is 1, the output will be 1 as well. Otherwise the output will be 0.
### Memory
Increasing RAM increases the computing speed because if there isn't enough memory to processes data then the data is going back to the hard drive that is slower causing  the PC to work slower than a PC with a significantly larger amount of memory that can store and transfer the data at higher rates.The difference between 64-bit and 32-bit data path is that 64-bit can process 64 bits of data per cycle compared to the 32-bit datapath. Making the 64-bit twice as fast than the 32-bit
### RAM vs. Hard Disk Storage
Two difference between RAM and hard disk storage is that RAM is much faster at processing data to the CPU while hard disk storage is slower and hard disk storage can hold the data for a longer time while RAM can only store data for a short time.
### Storage
### Latency and Transfer Rates 
The differnece between latrency and transfer rates is that latency is a driveâ€™s average access time between the time a request for data is made by the system and the time the data is available from the drive which is measured in miliseconds and transfer rates is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media and is a function of the recording frequency measured in megabytes per second.
### Solid State vs. Traditional Hard Drives
  The difference between a solid state drive and the traditional hard drive is that a solid state drive does not use disks, heads, platters, magnetic surfaces, spindles and other complex moving parts that the traditional hard drive uses.  The solid state is also faster and more effective than a hard drive since it does not rely on the movement of a disk that can wear out with time.
### Data Representation
The difference between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representation is the base powers they are based on. The decimal system is based on the base power of 10 and has 10 digits, the binary system is based on the base power of 2 and only has 2 digits. The binary system is also an 8-bit data representation and can only go up to 255. The hexadecimal system is a 16-digit data representation and is based off the base power of 16. Hexadecimal also uses letters to fill in for the digits passed the number 9. For example, 10 is A and 15 is represented by F.
### IEEE
IEEE is an organization that focuses on advancing the innovation and technology for the benefit of humanity. Their approach on the ethics of computing consists of ways of how to make technology grener for the environment and how to make sure that technology benefits all of humanity without hurting others.
